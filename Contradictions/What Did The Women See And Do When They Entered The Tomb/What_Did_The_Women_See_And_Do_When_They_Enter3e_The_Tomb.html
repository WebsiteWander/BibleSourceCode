            When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.<br>
            And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.<br>
            And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”<br>
            And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back—it was very large.<br>
            <span class="boldStory1Text highlightme">And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed.</span><br>
            And he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him.<br>
            But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.” <br>
            And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.

            But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared.<br><br>
            And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,<br>
            <span class="boldStory2Text highlightme">but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.<br>
            While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.</span><br>
            And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?<br>
            He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,<br>
            that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.”<br>
            And they remembered his words,<br>
            and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. <br>
