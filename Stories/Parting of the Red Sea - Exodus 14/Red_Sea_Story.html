        <span class="priestlyText">14 Then the Lord said to Moses, 2 “Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon. 3 Pharaoh will think, ‘The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.’ 4 And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord.” So the Israelites did this.

        </span><span class="jawhistText">5 When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, </span><span class="elohistText">Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, “What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!” </span><span class="jawhistText">6 So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him. </span><span class="elohistText">7 He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them. </span><span class="priestlyText">8 The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly. </span><span class="jawhistText">9 The Egyptians—</span><span class="priestlyText">all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, horsemen and troops</span><span class="jawhistText">—pursued the Israelites </span><span class="priestlyText">and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon.

        10 As Pharaoh approached, </span><span class="jawhistText">the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified </span><span class="priestlyText">and cried out to the Lord. </span><span class="elohistText">11 They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? 12 Didn’t we say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!”

        </span><span class="jawhistText">13 Moses answered the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again. 14 The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.”

        </span><span class="priestlyText">15 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on. 16 Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground. 17 I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen. 18 The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen.”

        </span><span class="elohistText">19 Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in front of Israel’s army, withdrew and went behind them. </span><span class="jawhistText">The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them, </span><span class="elohistText">20 coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. </span><span class="jawhistText">Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other side; so neither went near the other all night long.

        23 The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea. </span><span class="jawhistText">24 During the last watch of the night the Lord looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion. </span><span class="elohistText">25 He jammed the wheels of their chariots so that they had difficulty driving. </span><span class="jawhistText">And the Egyptians said, “Let’s get away from the Israelites!
